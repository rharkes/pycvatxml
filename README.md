# pycvatxml
WORK IN PROGRESS...

Should be able to read annotations in [cvat's xml notation](https://opencv.github.io/cvat/docs/manual/advanced/xml_format/) and export them to geojson or wkt for easy loading in other software.

At the moment it only reads in (parts of) the xml. 

# Installation
Use for test/develop only.

`pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ pycvatxml`
